2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eks-cluster-validator.git
   cd eks-cluster-validator
   ```

3. Set up the upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/techize/eks-cluster-validator.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install

# Install commit-msg hooks
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your development values
nano .env
```

### 4. Run Basic Tests

```bash
# Run the basic test suite
python test_basic.py

# Run with verbose output
python test_basic.py --verbose
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/techize/eks-cluster-validator/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Ensure all pre-commit hooks pass
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run basic tests
python test_basic.py

# Test specific functionality
python main.py --help
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your branch to your fork
- Create a Pull Request against the main branch
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Link to any related issues

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

This project follows PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports
- **Docstrings**: Use triple quotes with proper formatting
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names following PEP 8 conventions

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
black eks_validator/ main.py test_basic.py

# Check formatting without changes
black --check eks_validator/ main.py test_basic.py
```

### Linting

We use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:

```bash
# Run linting
flake8 eks_validator/ main.py test_basic.py

# With specific rules
flake8 --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503 eks_validator/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

All code must pass pre-commit hooks before being merged:

- `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing whitespace
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with newline
- `check-yaml`: Validates YAML syntax
- `black`: Code formatting
- `flake8`: Linting
- `validate-no-sensitive-data`: Custom security validation

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python test_basic.py

# Run with coverage (if pytest is configured)
pytest --cov=eks_validator

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_infrastructure.py
```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features, include appropriate tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage, especially for:

- Core validation logic
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Security-sensitive code

## Submitting Changes
