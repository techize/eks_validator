# EKS Cluster Validator Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines planned enhancements and improvements for the EKS Cluster Validator project. The project is currently at version 1.0.0 with core functionality complete and professional standards achieved.

## Current Status ✅

- **Version**: 1.0.0 (Initial Release)
- **Repository**: <https://github.com/techize/eks_validator>
- **Status**: Live and Public
- **Core Features**: Complete EKS validation engine with AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes health, and security checks

## Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 weeks)

### 🔧 Configuration Cleanup & Enhancement

#### Config.yaml Repository Commitment

- **Goal**: Make `config.yaml` committable to repository
- **Current Issue**: Contains placeholder/example data that should be configurable
- **Solution**:
  - Extract sensitive/confidential information to environment variables
  - Keep config.yaml as template with environment variable references
  - Maintain backward compatibility for direct config entry
  - Follow pattern established in pre-commit sensitive data validation

#### Environment Variable Strategy

```yaml
# config.yaml (committable)
aws:
  region: ${AWS_REGION:-us-east-1}
  profile: ${AWS_PROFILE}
  role_arn: ${AWS_ROLE_ARN}
  external_id: ${AWS_EXTERNAL_ID}

kubernetes:
  config_file: ${KUBECONFIG:-~/.kube/config}
  context: ${KUBERNETES_CONTEXT}
  namespace: ${KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE:-default}

validation:
  checks: ${VALIDATION_CHECKS:-cluster-health,node-status,pod-status}
  severity_threshold: ${VALIDATION_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD:-info}
  timeout: ${VALIDATION_TIMEOUT:-300}
  retries: ${VALIDATION_RETRIES:-3}
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. Update settings.py to support environment variable expansion
2. Create config.yaml template with env var placeholders
3. Update documentation with environment variable setup
4. Add validation for required environment variables
5. Update examples to show both config and env var approaches
